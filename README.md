# Introducing Throughput buckets
Throughput buckets help manage resource consumption for workloads sharing a Cosmos DB container by limiting the maximum throughput a bucket can consume.
- Each bucket has a maximum throughput percentage, capping the fraction of the containerâ€™s total throughput that it can consume.
- Requests assigned to a bucket can consume throughput only up to this limit.
- If the bucket exceeds its configured limit, subsequent requests are throttled.
- This mechanism helps in preventing resource contention, ensuring that no single workload consumes excessive throughput and impacts others.
